# 🤖 "It's Me, Hi, I'm The Problem, It's Me"
You've likely heard of Ticketmaster’s inability to handle bots, especially in November '22 when fans waited HOURS (just to get nothing), or most recently in August '23, with their Eras Tour Verified Fan program basically being a lottery ticket—thousands of fans were waitlisted.

The Events Tickets market is a huge opportunity. According to Statista:
> _"Revenue in the Event Tickets market is projected to reach $78B USD in 2023, [...] and an expected 760M users by 2027"_

Ticketmaster is a monopoly and their Verified Fan just doesn't work.

### ~~Onchain~~ Cruel Summer
Candian fans are [frustrated](https://ca.style.yahoo.com/canadian-taylor-swift-fans-toronto-shows-waitlist-142720549.html) that they're all on the waitlist for Swift's Eras Tour in Toronto (November 2024). There was only a 1 in 400 chance of getting a ticket ([source](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-taylor-swift-canada-tickets-codes-percentage/)), so it's actually easier to get into Harvard than to get a Eras ticket :P

### 👁️ You're The Only One Of You
With Swift Tickets' use of World ID, only **real** humans can buy tickets! This prevents bots from accessing the checkout.

There’s been privacy concerns with Worldcoin, but Swifties will literally do anything to get a ticket—in the future, I'll implement different verification levels based on orb / phone verification, which can differentiate their chances of getting in by how much we're able to prove they're human.
